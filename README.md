# Project_voting
Our project harnesses a powerful technological stack, incorporating React for the front-end, Tailwind CSS for styling, Firebase as the database, and Node.js for backend development. React ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Tailwind CSS enhances the visual appeal with a sleek design.

Firebase, serving as our database, enables real-time data updates, ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of voting information storage. Node.js, at the core of our backend, facilitates a seamless connection between the front-end and Firebase. This technological synergy aims to create a secure, user-friendly Aadhaar-based voting system, enhancing the transparency and integrity of the democratic process.
